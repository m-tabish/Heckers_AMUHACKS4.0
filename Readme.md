## Project Overview  

**Bluprnt** is a web application designed for **AMU Hacks 4.0** that leverages the power of the [Gemini API](https://gemini.com) to generate structured JSON responses. These responses are then dynamically rendered as interactive flowcharts on the frontend using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/). The goal is to help users visualize processes, learning roadmaps, and system workflows with ease.
